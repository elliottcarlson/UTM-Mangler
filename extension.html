        Want to mess with SEO people and those marketers trying to optimize
        another fucking branding tweet? Me too.

        Now when you go to a page, or click a link, that contains something like 
        "utm_something=Facebook", it will automatically get mangled! You are redirected to
        the same page with a much more interesting set of parameters for the analytics
        team to sort through.
