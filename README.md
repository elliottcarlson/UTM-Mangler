Want to mess with SEO people and those marketers trying to optimize another fucking branding tweet? Me too.

Drag this to your bookmarks bar: <a href="javascript: (function () { var jsCode = document.createElement('script'); jsCode.setAttribute('src', 'http://stilldrinking.org/utms/utm-mangler.js'); document.body.appendChild(jsCode); }());">UTM Mangler</a>

Now if you see something in your browser url that looks like "utm_something=Facebook," just click the UTM Mangler bookmark and poof! You are redirected to the same page with a much more interesting set of parameters for the analytics team to sort through.
