Want to mess with SEO people and those marketers trying to optimize another fucking branding tweet? Me too.

Drag this to your bookmarks bar: <a href="javascript: (function () { var jsCode = document.createElement('script'); jsCode.setAttribute('src', 'http://stilldrinking.org/utms/utm-mangler.js'); document.body.appendChild(jsCode); }());">UTM Mangler</a>. NOTE: You can't really drag that. Github doesn't like javascript links. But you can go here to get roughly this same readme, with a link you can drag: http://stilldrinking.org/utms/utm-mangler.html.

Now if you see something in your browser url that looks like "utm_something=Facebook," just click the UTM Mangler bookmark and poof! You are redirected to the same page with a much more interesting set of parameters for the analytics team to sort through.

Also, the lovely and talented <a href="http://blog.sublim.nl/">Elliott</a> packaged this up as a chrome extension to save a click.
